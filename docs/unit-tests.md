## Unit tests

We use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), for running unit test and generating test coverage reports.
See config in property `jest` in `package.json`.

Just type the following to run all test once:

```
npm test
```

You can watch changes and run tests automatically with:

```
npm run test:watch
```
This comes in handy since itâ€™s blazingly fast. It runs only tests related to changed files per default but has an interactive mode which enables you to run all if needed.

### For those who are new to Jest

Writing test with Jest feels pretty much the same like writing tests with Mocha/Chai|Jasmine.
Just have a look at our small dummy test in `src/app/__tests__`.

Placing tests in `__tests__` directories is a default from Jest.
You can adjust the name of your tests-directory with the `testDirectoryName` configuration option.

The most important things to know:
- [API docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/api.html)
- [Assertions](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html)

*Your are not forced to use Jests assertions. You can alternatively use `assert` by just requiring it or install and use Chai.*

We strongly recommend to check the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html) to dive deeper and read for instance how Jest can help you with mocking.
